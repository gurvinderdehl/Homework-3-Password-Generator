# Homework-3-PasswordGenerator
# Introduction
The point of this assignment is put everything we have learn't so far to test. By creating a password generator, which gives us a password according to what responses the user enters to our prompts. This had to have been the hardest task I have done so far. 

### What I learnt?
I picked up many things along the way when trying to complete this task, whether it be the use of if else statements, which included loops. These statements were the hardest for me, as I had to figure how to use the users repsonse to generate a password. At the begining I kept getting a value of undefined for the password, but got there in the end.
#### For the future
I would like to take this break we have to go over everything we have done in class so far and really come to grips with what was used and when carrying out this task, to really digest everything. An example of things I would like to get a better understanding of is loops and the math.floor/random methods. During this task I failed many times to generate a password, so my note for the future above all is to keep pushing and researching. The reason for this is because it's not going to be the only time where I am stuck and can't figure it out straight away.
